# tscottdev-trigger-framework

I reference this framework from time to time and thought it might be handy to create a repo for [Tony Scott's](https://github.com/tscottdev) 2013 code recipe, [Trigger Pattern for Tidy, Streamlined, Bulkified Triggers](https://developer.secure.force.com/cookbook/recipe/trigger-pattern-for-tidy-streamlined-bulkified-triggers).
